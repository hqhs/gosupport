Using alembic for database management
===

After some research I've decided that Go ORMs are not that powerful after all
and requires a lot of code to be written. For faster development I'm going to
use python's alembic. After first beta version migration scripts could be
written by hand, because we can't change schema more often then 1 time per minor
release.
